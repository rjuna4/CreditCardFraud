# Credit Card Fraud Detection
<h2>
      Overview :
</h2>
This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model designed to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. By using classification algorithms, the model aims to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, improving the ability to identify potential fraud in real-time scenarios.

<h2>
      Project Components :
</h2>
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed by scaling features.
Model Selection: Various machine learning models were evaluated, like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others. Random Forest was chosen for its high accuracy and balance between precision and recall.
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve are used to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.
Fraud Detection: The model is tested using held-out test data to ensure it generalizes well to detecting fraudulent transactions with new data.

<h2>
      Dataset :
</h2>
The dataset used for training the model can be downloaded from Kaggle:

[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023/data)

<h2>
      Results :
</h2>
The Random Forest classifier achieved high performance, with an AUC-ROC score of 99%, demonstrating its ability to effectively distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
